PrivShare - A simple location encrypting tool

PrivShare  is a simple and lightweight web application designed for encrypting and decrypting geographical coordinates in a user-friendly and visually appealing way. The application allows users to input latitude and longitude values manually or use their deviceâ€™s geolocation to fetch their current coordinates. These coordinates are then encrypted using Base64 encoding, generating a shareable link that can be easily distributed. The app also features a decryption tool, allowing users to input an encoded string and decode it back into the original latitude and longitude.

Built with a clean HTML structure, styled using CSS for a modern and responsive design, and powered by JavaScript for functionality, PrivShare is an excellent demonstration of integrating frontend technologies. Key features include interactive buttons for encrypting and decrypting, intuitive input fields, and dynamically generated shareable links. The design includes background animations for an enhanced user experience, making the app both functional and visually engaging.

While PrivShare showcases the simplicity and utility of encoding and decoding data, it uses Base64 encoding, which is not secure for protecting sensitive information. This project is intended for educational purposes and should not be used for handling confidential data.
